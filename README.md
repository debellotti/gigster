# Gig Migration Challenge

A three-phase data migration pipeline that ingests transaction data, processes it through a transformation layer, validates results, and ensures data integrity.

## Architecture

```
data/transactions.csv
  → POST /api/transactions/load-csv
  → Kafka: transactions-topic          (raw: user_id, transaction_date)
  → NiFi Transformer (Phase 2)
      ├── PostgreSQL: transactions_target
      └── Kafka: transactions-processed  (renamed: account_id, timestamp)
            → Java Consumer
            └── PostgreSQL: transactions_source
  → Python reconciliation
```

## Phases

**Phase 1 — Java Service** (`java-service/`)
Spring Boot service that exposes REST endpoints, reads the CSV file, publishes rows to Kafka, and consumes the processed events to persist them in PostgreSQL.

**Phase 2 — NiFi Transformer** (simulated inside the Java service)
Consumes raw messages from `transactions-topic`, renames fields (`user_id → account_id`, `transaction_date → timestamp`), writes to `transactions_target`, and republishes to `transactions-processed`.
> The actual NiFi container is included in docker-compose but the transformation logic is handled by `NiFiTransformerService` inside the Java service.

**Phase 3 — Python Reconciliation** (`scripts/reconciliation.py`)
Connects to PostgreSQL and validates that `transactions_source` and `transactions_target` are consistent: record counts, NULL checks, and full cross-table reconciliation by transaction ID.

## Running from scratch

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3 + `psycopg2-binary` (for reconciliation only)
- Ports `8080`, `5432`, `9092`, `2181` free

### Step 1 — Start the infrastructure

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres kafka zookeeper
```

This starts PostgreSQL (with the schema from `db/init.sql`) and the Kafka broker. Wait about 15 seconds for them to be fully ready.

```bash
# Verify postgres is accepting connections
docker exec gig-postgres pg_isready -U gig_user -d gig_db

# Verify kafka is up (should list __consumer_offsets)
docker exec gig-kafka kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```

### Step 2 — Build and start the Java service

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build java-service
```

The first build takes 2-3 minutes because Maven downloads dependencies. Subsequent builds are faster.

Wait for the service to finish starting:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f java-service
# Wait until you see: "Started GigMigrationApplication"
# Then Ctrl+C to exit the log tail
```

Or just poll the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/transactions/health
# Expected: {"status":"running"}
```

### Step 3 — Trigger the pipeline

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/transactions/load-csv
# Expected: {"message":"CSV loading triggered","rows":10}
```

This reads `data/transactions.csv` and publishes each row to Kafka. The transformer picks them up, writes to `transactions_target`, and forwards to `transactions-processed`. The consumer then saves them to `transactions_source`. The whole flow completes in a few seconds.

### Step 4 — Verify via REST API

```bash
# All transactions in the source table
curl http://localhost:8080/api/transactions | jq .

# Single transaction
curl http://localhost:8080/api/transactions/TXN001 | jq .
```

You can also run the full API verification script (requires `jq`):

```bash
./scripts/verify-api.sh
```

### Step 5 — Run Phase 3 reconciliation

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary   # first time only
python3 scripts/reconciliation.py
```

Expected output:

```
Starting Phase 3 Reconciliation...
Running checks:
  [PASS] Record count — source: 10, target: 10
  [PASS] Data integrity — 0 issue(s)
  [PASS] Reconciliation — 0 mismatches, 0 missing in target, 0 missing in source

Overall result : PASS
```

## Reset / clean start

To wipe everything and start fresh (drops DB volumes):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

Then repeat from Step 1.

---

## Useful commands

```bash
# Follow Java service logs
docker-compose logs -f java-service

# Check record counts directly in Postgres
docker exec gig-postgres psql -U gig_user -d gig_db \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gig.transactions_source;"
docker exec gig-postgres psql -U gig_user -d gig_db \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gig.transactions_target;"

# List Kafka topics
docker exec gig-kafka kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```
